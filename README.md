Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Alina :)

For the past five years I have been working as a finance manager at one Company in Munich. At the same time I have been learning programming as a hobby. Initial inspiration came from Apple WWDC 2016 presentation where Swift Playgrounds App for iPad was introduced with a slogan Â«Now everyone can learn how to codeÂ». I started with HTML/CSS and then moved on to studying JavaScript React Developer Profession at HTML Academy. I spend quite a lot of time working closely with developers, QA and other team members there. 

I have created projects using such technologies:

 â€¢ JavaScript, React, Redux, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS
 â€¢ React Hooks 
 â€¢ Styled components 
 â€¢ API service-based architectures 
 â€¢ WebPack, NPM 
 â€¢ Git/Github
 
I enjoyed the problem solving that lies underneath it and I enjoyed creating applications.
Iâ€™ve been interested in programming for quite a while now and what started as a hobby is now my passion. I love programming and I can no longer imagine my life without it.

I'd like to find a great job as a frontend-developer.
